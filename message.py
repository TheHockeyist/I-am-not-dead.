So guys, I'm not dead. I've just been handling summer. And I've lost a lot of interest from Github. :-/.

Also, I've been planning for 2018, and I plan to perhaps be on here more active,
but I already have ten New Year's resolutions for 2018 and it's not even September.

I may or may not continue here, but if I don't, I have my own best interests at heart. I may learn Python in 2018, I may not.
I already have a lot of things planned out for 2018, so if I'm inactive on Github through 2018, you can blame me and my resolutions.

Perhaps I'll start comics or animations. I don't know yet. I have a life outside of here.

Also, I'm starting college next week, so Github will be neglected. Wish me luck.
